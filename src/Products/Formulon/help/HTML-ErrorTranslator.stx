ErrorTranslator: Handle errors in data storage methods gracefully
  
  The ErrorTranslator handles (and translates) errors that occur,
  when submitted and validated form data is processed.

  Therefore you need to create an instance of the ErrorTranslatorRegistry
  somewhere up in your ZODB hierarchy, so it will do all the translation
  automagically. 

  In the registry, you can create TranslationRules, that say how specific
  errors should be handled/translated.
